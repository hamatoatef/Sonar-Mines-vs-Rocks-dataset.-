## Data Exploration

- The focus of this project is the Sonar Mines vs Rocks dataset.

- The problem is to predict metal or rock objects from sonar return data.

- Each pattern is a set of 60 numbers in the range 0.0 to 1.0.

- Each number represents the energy within a particular frequency band, integrated over a certain period of time.

- The label associated with each record contains the letter R if the object is a rock and M if it is a mine (metal cylinder).

- The numbers in the labels are in increasing order of aspect angle, but they do not encode the angle directly.
