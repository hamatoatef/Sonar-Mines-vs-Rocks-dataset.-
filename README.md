# Sonar-Mines-vs-Rocks-dataset.-

## Data Exploration

-The focus of this project is the Sonar Mines vs Rocks dataset.

-The problem is to predict metal or rock objects from sonar return data.

-Each pattern is a set of 60 numbers in the range 0.0 to 1.0.

-Each number represents the energy within a particular frequency band, integrated over a certain period of time.

-The label associated with each record contains the letter R if the object is a rock and M if it is a mine (metal cylinder).

-The numbers in the labels are in increasing order of aspect angle, but they do not encode the angle directly.
